==10496== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==10496== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,

==10496==   /usr/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=10496 ...command...
==10496== 
==10496== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==10496==   /path/to/gdb ./a.out
==10496== and then give GDB the following command
==10496==   target remote | /usr/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=10496
==10496== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
